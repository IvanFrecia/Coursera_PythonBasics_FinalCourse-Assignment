Question One:

" 1) Below are a set of scores that students have received in the past semester.
Write code to determine how many are 90 or above and assign that result to the value a_scores."

Question Two:

" 2) Write code that uses the string stored in org and creates an acronym which is assigned to the variable acro.
# Only the first letter of each word should be used, each letter in the acronym should be a capital letter,
# and there should be nothing to separate the letters of the acronym.
# Words that should not be included in the acronym are stored in the list stopwords.
# For example, if org was assigned the string “hello to world” then the resulting acronym should be “HW”."

Question Three:

" 3) Write code that uses the string stored in sent and creates an acronym which is assigned to the variable acro.
# The first two letters of each word should be used, each letter in the acronym should be a capital letter,
# and each element of the acronym should be separated by a “. ” (dot and space).
# Words that should not be included in the acronym are stored in the list stopwords.
# For example, if sent was assigned the string “height and ewok wonder” then the resulting acronym should be “HE. EW. WO”"

Question Four:

"4) A palindrome is a phrase that, if reversed, would read the exact same.
# Write code that checks if p_phrase is a palindrome by reversing it and then checking if the reversed
# version is equal to the original. Assign the reversed version of p_phrase to the variable r_phrase
# so that we can check your work."

Question Five:

" 5) Provided is a list of data about a store’s inventory where each item in the list represents the name of an item,
# how much is in stock, and how much it costs. Print out each item in the list with the same formatting,
# using the .format method (not string concatenation).
# For example, the first print statment should read The store has 12 shoes, each for 29.99 USD."
